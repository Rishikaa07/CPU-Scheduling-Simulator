# 8-Bit CPU Simulator
A custom-designed 8-bit CPU simulation built using CircuitVerse, complete with a control unit, ALU, instruction set, memory interface, and microinstruction logic. This project simulates a basic Von Neumann architecture processor capable of executing a variety of low-level instructions.

### üìÅ How to Use the .cv File

# 8-Bit CPU Simulator
A custom-designed 8-bit CPU simulation built using CircuitVerse, complete with a control unit, ALU, instruction set, memory interface, and microinstruction logic. This project simulates a basic Von Neumann architecture processor capable of executing a variety of low-level instructions.

### Key Features:

Implements multiple scheduling algorithms:
First Come First Serve (FCFS)
Shortest Job First (SJF) (Preemptive & Non-Preemptive)
Round Robin (RR) with configurable time quantum
Priority Scheduling (Preemptive & Non-Preemptive)

### Tech Stack

Language: Python
Concepts: Queues, Sorting, OS scheduling, Time simulation
Output: Gantt chart (ASCII), Average Waiting Time, Turnaround Time

# -CPU-Scheduling-Simulator-
The CPU Scheduling Simulator is a Python-based educational tool designed to visualize and analyze how different CPU scheduling algorithms operate in an operating system. It helps users understand the behavior and performance of each algorithm by simulating process execution, computing performance metrics, and generating Gantt charts.

### Key Features:

Implements multiple scheduling algorithms:
First Come First Serve (FCFS)
Shortest Job First (SJF) (Preemptive & Non-Preemptive)
Round Robin (RR) with configurable time quantum
Priority Scheduling (Preemptive & Non-Preemptive)
